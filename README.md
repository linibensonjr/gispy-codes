# gispy-codes

This is repo for the collection of GIS `code notes`, ranging from field calculations using python to original code blocks and model builder.

## format structure
The structure for the codes are going to be simple. In the very least, I'm dividing the repo into two - a section for arcgis and another for qgis

[ArcGIS](https://github.com/linibensonjr/gispy-codes/tree/main/arcgis)  

[QGIS](https://github.com/linibensonjr/gispy-codes/tree/main/qgis)

[WebGIS](https://github.com/linibensonjr/gispy-codes/tree/main/webgis)
